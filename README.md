<Header><strong>ITOnlineLearning Website Project</strong></Header>
<br>
<br>
<P>
  This website project was developed as part of my course at ITOnlineLearning, particularly at the culmination of the HTML section.
  <br>The scenario was to create a website as a demonstration of the information I was taught over the duration of the HTML course.
  <br>One of the main challenges of this project came from the gallery page, as both sourcing the images from dedicated folders, as well as the CSS involved in its organisation, proved to be a greater task than I had first assumed.
  <br>However, having overcome this obstacle, I successfully created a website which met all criteria of the course finale.
