        <p><i>"I was looking for an older dog from a location close to me, but all other sites were showing me dogs from beyond my possible range. However, when I tried Pet Love, they were able to find me an absolutely lovely older dog in my area that was looking for a new home, and even provided me with immediate contact details! I am very happy with my new addition to the family!"</i></p>

        <p><i>"My dog at home was feeling lonely whilst I was out for work so I decided to adopt another dog to give him a friend, and this site was truly a lifesaver. I struggle with most technology but this was easy to use and straightforward, and the support staff were most helpful. I'm very glad I was able to get my dog a friend and would wholeheartedly recommend this site."</i></p>

        <p><i>"My dog recently had a litter of puppies, and I wasn't able to care for them all so I was looking to put them up for adoption. One of my friends recommended me this site, and I'm so thankful they did! It was incredibly easy to set up listings for each of the puppies, and I was able to meet and talk to the potential buyers to make sure that this was the right choice for them. Would definitely recommend!"</i></p>

        <p><i>"I had been searching for a specific breed of dog to adopt for the longest time, but every site I checked didn't have a single listing in my area. However when a friend recommended me to try this site, I found not 1 but 2 available listings! I was amazed at how easy the contact process was, and I was able to collect my new dog within a week of seeing the listing!"</i></p>
