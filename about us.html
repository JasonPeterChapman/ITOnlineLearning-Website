    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Pet Love was founded on May 4th, 2020, which was during the pandemic of that time. During this pandemic, many people were forced to spend extended periods of time stuck at home, and realised that they couldn't provide for their pets needs. As such, many animals were put up for adoption during this crisis, which is what inspired us here at Pet Love to step up and help these animals find the better life they deserve.</p>

    <div class="info">
    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>Our goal for Pet Love is to keep on rehoming unfortunate animals into better families, and make this process as easy and accessible as it can possibly be. When we first started in 2020, we had managed to rehome <strong>25</strong> animals over the course of the rest of the year. However, in 2021, our clientele shot up in numbers, and we rehomed a whopping <strong>300</strong> animals! In this present day, we have rehomed almost <strong>1500</strong> animals total, and are hoping to keep up the pace and reach <strong>2000</strong> by the end of the year.</p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="info">
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Aside from continuing to rehome animals into more suitable environments, we do have some other aspirations in our calendar. For one, we hope to bolster our roster of helpers, which range from support agents to temporary carers whilst an animal is waiting to be chosen. We also hope to expand our effective range, such that we can help animals in distant places find the home they deserve.</p>

    <p>Here at PetLove, we value the happiness and longevity of an animal over everything else, which is why we are dedicated to finding every pet a loving and caring home so that they may live the life that they deserve. We were founded in 2020 during the pandemic, as many owners were putting their animals up for adoption due to the extended periods of time they were forced to spend with them. So far we have rehomed almost <strong>1500</strong> animals, and are hoping to reach <strong>2000</strong> by 2025! </p>
